# Patients-waitlist-analysis--Healthcare-Dataset
Thrilled to share a sneak peek into my latest project utilizing Power BI, aimed at transforming patient care through data-driven insights! üìäüåê
This dataset is an publicly available dataset of patients waitlist. This dataset contains two types of data categories:
1) Inpatient Data : A patient who stays in hospital while under treatment.
2) Outpatient data: A patient who receives medical treatment without getting admitted to hospital.

## Overall Objectives - Project Goals:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Track Current Status: This project enables real-time tracking of patients' waitlists, providing healthcare professionals with up-to-the-minute information to make informed decisions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Historical Trends: Unveiling historical monthly trends in inpatient and outpatient categories sheds light on patterns, enabling proactive measures for improved patient care.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Specialty-Level and Age Profile Analysis: Granular analysis at the specialty and age levels empowers healthcare professionals with detailed insights for targeted interventions.

## Steps Involved:
1) Requirement gathering
2)Data Collection
3) Transformation and Modelling
4)Data Visualization Blueprint
5) Dashboard design and Layout
6) Interactivity and Navigation
7)Testing and Publishing
8) Maintainance and Refresh

## Metrics Required:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Average Median Waitlist: A key metric to gauge the efficiency of our healthcare system, providing insights into the time patients spend on waitlists.
